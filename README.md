Analyzing NFL Player performance by draft position
Player Statistic Dates: 2000-2023
Draft Dates: 2000-2020

Reason for Stopping in draft 2020:
I don't think 1 year is enough of a time to showcase the ability of players. I recognize that some players are a 'plug-and-play' type and have been used as such, but this is project aims to look at overall performance.
3 Years avoids the "Sophmore Slump" and gives somewhat of an overall look.
